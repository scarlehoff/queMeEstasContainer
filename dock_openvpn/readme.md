# Docker image for openvpn

Small docker image for a quick setup of a personal use VPN.

To get all of this up and running:

1. First generate the certificates, keys, etc for your server
2. Create some clients (or do it later, doesn't really matter)
3. Build the docker file
4. Run said docker file

```bash
./easy_crypto.sh
./new_client.sh DentArthur
source sh_variables
create_container
run_container
```

The `sh_variables` script contains also two helper functions to build and run the containers.

Note: the client-common.txt basically defines how the client is going to connect to the VPN so it will be different for different servers, change at least line 3 of that file!
